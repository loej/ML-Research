<h1 align="center"> ðŸ§¬  Machine Learning Neural Network Lab ðŸ§¬ </h1>

MLNN is located in Rutgers University - New Brunswick. We are a team of undergraduate and graduate students passionate about machine learning and the genetics of compulsive behaviors (such as alcoholism and drug addiction) and neuro-sensory disorders (such as neuropathic pain). 

## Purpose
Using machine learning, the team uses data from Dr. Yu's Biology Labs to classify the genetics of compulsive behavior and neuro-sensory disorders.

## Current Objectives
Currently the team is using the following structures to classify this data:

- Random Forest Decision Tree
  - binary, trinary, multi class, continuous outcome variable
